# Number_Guess_Game

In this project, I built a program that rolls a pair of dice and asks the user to guess a number. Based on the user's guess, the program should determine a winner. If the user's guess is greater than the total value of the dice roll, they win! Otherwise, the computer wins.

**To run: Make sure Python is insatlled on your machine. Download the .py file, Open a console window and type Python** *filename.py*
